# My-homework-and-project---cs-61a
This is a record and a note for my study in CS 61a, an online Python course by the University of Berkeley
CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Syllabus:  https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/

Useful Resources:  https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa21/resources/

Other CS 61 series introduction:

--CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

--CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.

--CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.
